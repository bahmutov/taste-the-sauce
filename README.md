## Install

Requires Node v16+

$ npm install
```

## Run

To start the application if you are using Node v16 use `npm start` command. If you are using Node v17+ use `npm run start-18` command (because of this [SSL error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69692842/error-message-error0308010cdigital-envelope-routinesunsupported)).

In both cases, it should print

```
